## Learning about Diffusion models 
<a name="Learning-about-Diffusion-models"></a>
While there exist many tutorials for Diffusion models, below you can find an overview of some of the best introduction blog posts and video:

- [What are Diffusion Models?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbLgFrlTnGU&t=1s): an introduction video, which introduces the general idea of diffusion models and some high-level math about how the model works

## Diffusion History
<a name="Diffusion-History"></a>
Diffusion models are a type of generative model inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, introduced by [Sohl-Dickstein et al., (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585). The model learns to invert a diffusion process, that gradually adds noise to a data sample. This process is a Markov chain consisting of diffusion steps, which add random Gaussian noise to a data sample. The diffusion model is used to learn to invert this process. While the paper was presented  in 2015, it took several years for the diffusion models to get widespread attention in the research community. Diffusion models are a type of generative model and in this field, the main focus are vision based applications, thus all theory papers mentioned in the text below are mostly focused on image synthesis or similar tasks related to it. 

There are two perspectives to view diffusion models. The first one is based on the initial idea of  [Sohl-Dickstein et al., (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585), while the other is based on a different direction of research known as score-based generative models. In 2019 [Song & Ermon, (2019)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/3001ef257407d5a371a96dcd947c7d93-Paper.pdf) proposed the _noise-conditioned score network (NCSN)_, which is a predecessor to the score-based diffusion model. The main idea was to learn the score function of the unknown data distribution using a neural network. This approach had been around before, however their paper and the subsequent work [Song & Ermon (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09011) enabled scaling score-based models to high-dimension data distributions and made them competitive on image-generation tasks. The key idea in their work was to perturb the data distribution with various levels of Gaussian noise and learn a noise-conditional score model to predict the score of the perturbed data distributions. 


In 2020, [Ho et al., (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) introduced  _denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM)_, which served as the foundation for the success of Diffusion models. At that time, Diffusion models still were not  competitive with state-of-the-art generate models such as GANs. However, this changed rapidly the following year when [Nichol & Dhariwal (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233) improved upon the previous paper and demonstrated, that Diffusion models are competitive with GANs on image synthesis tasks. Nevertheless, it is important to note, that Diffusion models are not the jack of all trades. Diffusion models still struggle with certain image traits such as generating realistic faces or generating the right amount of fingers. 

Another important idea for diffusion models in the context of image generation has been the introduction of _latent diffusion models_ by [Rombach & Blattman et al., (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.1075). By training the diffusion model in the latent space rather than the image space directly, they were able to improve the sampling and training speed and made it possible for everyone to run their own diffusion model on local PCs with a single GPU. Recent AI generated art is mostly based on the stable AI implementation of latent diffusion models and is open source: [Github repo](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion).

**Conditional Diffusion models**
The initial diffusion models are usually trained on marginal distributions $p(x)$, but conditional image generation is also an research area of great interest. Therefore, we need conditional diffusion models to _guide_ the generation process. Currently, there are three common methods to enable conditional generation with diffusion models:

- Classifier Guided Diffusion by [Dhariwal & Nichol (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233)
- Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by [Ho & Salimans, (2021)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qw8AKxfYbI)
- directly training a conditional diffusion model $p(x|z)$ 

CFG is used in many applications, since it allows to train a conditional diffusion model  and unconditional diffusion model at the same time. During inference, we can combine both models and control the generation process using a guidance weight. 

**Diffusion models perspectives**

As previously mentioned, diffusion models can be viewed from two different perspectives:
- the denoising diffusion probabilistic perspective based on [Ho et al., (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) 
- the score-based model perspective based on  [Song & Ermon, (2019)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/3001ef257407d5a371a96dcd947c7d93-Paper.pdf)

There has been a lot of effort to combine these two views into one general framework. The best generalization has been the idea of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) first presented in [Song et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13456) and further developed to unified framework in [Karras et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00364).

While diffusion models have mainly been applied in the area of generative modeling, recent work has shown promising applications of diffusion models in robotics. For instance, diffusion models have been used for behavior cloning and offline reinforcement learning, and have also been used to generate more diverse training data for robotics tasks.

Diffusion models offer several useful properties in the context of robotics, including:

- *Expressiveness*: can learn arbitrarily complicated data-distributions 
- *Training stability*: they are easy to train especially in contrast GANs or EBMs
- *Multimodality*: they are able to learn complicated multimodal distributions
- *Compositionality*: Diffusion models can combined in a flexible way to jointly generate new samples

Overall, diffusion models have the potential to be a valuable tool for robotics.
